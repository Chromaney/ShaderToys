# ShaderToys
Collection of my shaders on Shadertoy. Licenced under CC BY-NC-SA.
Since shaders on Shadertoy have several code sections, they have been merged into one shader file with "subsections".

* `Fingerprints.glsl` - an effect of fingerprints on the back side of "glass". [Link to Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/mlKcWD).
