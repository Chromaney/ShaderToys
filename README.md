# ShaderToys
Collection of my shaders on Shadertoy. Licenced under CC BY-NC-SA.
Since shaders on Shadertoy have several code sections, they have been merged into one shader file with "subsections" where necessary.

* `Fingerprints.glsl` - an effect of fingerprints on the back side of "glass". [Link to Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/mlKcWD).

* `Semiconductor.glsl` - a test of various SDF raymarching techniques in 3D. Includes lighting, shape booleans, latticed objects, fog. Some stuff (more complex shapes, reflections) had to be scrapped due to performance concerns. [Link to Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/lcj3z3).
