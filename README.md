# ShaderToys
Collection of my shaders on Shadertoy. Licenced under CC BY-NC-SA.
Since shaders on Shadertoy have several code sections, they have been merged into one shader file with "subsections" where necessary.

* `Fingerprints.glsl` - an effect of fingerprints on the back side of "glass". [Link to Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/mlKcWD).

* `Semiconductor.glsl` - a test of various SDF raymarching techniques in 3D. Includes lighting, shape booleans, latticed objects, fog. Some stuff (more complex shapes, reflections) had to be scrapped due to performance concerns. [Link to Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/lcj3z3).

* `CelestialClock.glsl` - animated raymarched fractal-like structure with multiple lights. [Link to Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/43BGRm).

* `DreamField.glsl` - animated colorful 2D texture with dithering. [Link to Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Mf3GRB).

* `Aurora.glsl` - a simple-ish 2D aurora effect. [Link to Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Mfy3Dz).

* `BetweenOrderAndChaos.glsl` - A shader born out of desire to try something CA/WFC-inspired. Creates a picture with moving parts of chaotic colors and orderly gradients. [Link to Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4cSBz1).

* `LondonDots.glsl` - A simple animated effect of turning an image into "dots". Inspired by a random piece of art I have seen recently. (Name is only because of the image used.) [Link to Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/X3cczS).

* `ShapesAndInversions.glsl` - Playing around with the idea of inversive geometry. [Link to Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/l33fR4).

* `MechanicalDream.glsl` - Tried an approach to generating many objects that relies on combining regular grids of different scale and a lot of randomization. With a side of size-coding / code golfing. (More like, mechanical nightmare with how none of the gears connect or sync up.) [Link to Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XXyBzy).

* `CapturedSun.glsl` - Shader that started as a way to put to use a cool smooth noise texture that I stumbled upon while making [previous one](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XXyBzy). Uses some pseudo-3D visuals. [Link to Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3cS3Dh).

* `(De)fragmentation.glsl` - A sizecoding / codegolfing exercise for a neat randomly discovered visual effect. Currently 240 characters, according to Shadertoy. Name is because of visual similarity to Windows defragmentation tool icon and to the process itself. [Link to Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tf2SWz).

* `FacetsOfUnreality.glsl` - Another sizecoding thing, this time it started as such. Currently 184 chars. Still feels like there's room for improvement, but any modification I managed to find makes the effect way worse. [Link to Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/t3lGR7).

* `TimelessComet.glsl` - Just an experiment with IFSs. Took a while to make it look somewhat interesting. And current shader limitations don't help with getting high quality images.
Some of the ideas have been referenced from [here](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4dXGWS). Some transformation functions (and parts of idea) taken from [here](https://flam3.com/flame_draves.pdf). [Link to Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3XXGR2).

* `Neonmorphosis.glsl` - Experimenting with pathtraced lighting. 2D case for simplicity. [Link to Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WcKSRW).

* `FlowerAndWater_SunAndSky.glsl` - Didn't expect to get this much value out of a small smooth noise function. Started as an attempt to recreate [this](https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/268/plains) but then went its own direction. [Link to Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wXG3WR).

* `QuantumEntanglement.glsl` - Another usage of a smooth noise function. A result of experimenting with [another shader](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wXG3WR). [Link to Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3XySRh).
